h1. Prick.js

h3. A simple web framework for Node.js

p. Took me around 6hrs to write it. Going to sleep now. I know documentation sucks coz there's none. I'll do the docs and then turn it into a CommonJS pkg first thing tomorrow morning.

h2. TODO

* Rewrite some of the path matching code (need to use the url module)
* Docs
* turn into CommonJS pkg
* list this on the node wiki
* Take a look at how other frameworks handle pattern-based paths.

p. Until then take a look at sample-server.js for clues :)
